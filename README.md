## Introduction
- Score Maxxing is a website for IVY-Education that specializes in GRE and GMAT preperation courses. The webstie aims to be functional but also motivate them when needed.
- The need of the website arises when the preparation courses are widespread all over the internet and to sum all of it at one place
- Eliminates repetitive problems by implementing self trained AI model which is fed with premade questions so to alter them and make new ones
- Existing websites on the net have paywalls for unlocking basic features and that's where Score Maxxing comes into the picture
- AI based tests to determine how much a student knows about a subject and can suggest better practices

## Roadmap
1. On logging in, you will be prompted with an AI preliminary test which determines that how much a user knows about a subject so the AI can design modules and can suggest what to do next to achieve better score
2. Also after selecting and registering for a course, the course can be viewed in the profile tab so to maintain how many courses a student has and how much of the course has the user completed
3. Unlimited amount of quality mock tests and notes which can be unlocked by paying a small nominal fee per user
4. Video lectures and study planner are provided for free as basic features
5. Performance review after every mock test so as to know where the student lacks and hence can improve GRE and GMAT scores. Also providing the capabilities to compare the score with the target score and improvement over time

## Business model
It is a freemium model where all the basic features like video lectures and study planner are free but the mock tests and notes are locked with a basic one-time fee which is nominal. 

The plus point of this feature is that the main features are set to be free which sets the platform apart from the existing ones and also the nominal fee on the mock tests can build up to a good amount of revenue when a particular topic notes or mock tests are purchased by many students.
